     * One batched read of a declared aggregate for a whole page: a grouped
     * scalar select over the record class, joined along the declared path and
     * narrowed to the page's keys, never touching the page query itself. The
     * key projection, the grouping and the narrowing each run per identifier
     * field, so a key of any width addresses the row it names.
     *
     * The joins are inner, so a key whose related set is empty produces no
     * group and is absent from the result rather than zero — what a missing
     * key reads as is the caller's decision, not this one's. The scope closure
     * arrives already bound, and is handed the builder and the alias of the
     * path's last hop so it can narrow the aggregated set.
     *
     * The key narrowing is added *after* the scope has run, because Doctrine's
     * `where()` replaces where Eloquent's adds: a scope written with the
     * Filament reflex would otherwise drop the narrowing this batch depends on.
     *
     * The keys are chunked and the scope runs once, on the pristine builder:
     * each chunk narrows a **copy** of it, because a second predicate ANDed
     * onto the first answers nothing, and every chunk keeps the one parameter
     * base: a base carrying a chunk index of its own is what
     * {@see IdentifierConstraint::assertParameterBase()} refuses.
